			We all have dreams and goals, not just one or two but a tone, and we all want to achieve them one by one but don't know which one to start with. Since they are so many we only deal with the ones that can be remembered easily and end up leaving the rest. Do you have a place where you have listed all the dreams and goals you want to achieve? I bet No. Most of Us keep them in mind hence forget. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
			My Plans App wants to change all that and make sure you achieve everything systematic without leaving out a thing be it long term or short term goals. My Plans gives you a chance to create your own Bucket list which helps you keep track of all that you have planned to achieve.
